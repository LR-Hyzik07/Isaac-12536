			<p>His mass-energy equivalence formula E=mc2, which arises from relatiity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation".</p>
			<p>He received the nobel prize in physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of the quantum theory.</p>
